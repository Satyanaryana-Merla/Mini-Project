 Consolidated Summary of All Cash Flows

This section provides a summary of all cash flows generated during the amortization schedule calculation. It includes the totals for payments, prepayments, interest, principal, and the final loan balance for all loans combined.

 Key Metrics

1. Total Payment: The sum of all scheduled monthly payments across all loans.
2. Total Prepayment: The sum of all prepayments made across all loans (based on CPR).
3. Total Interest Paid: The cumulative interest paid across all loans over their terms.
4. Total Principal Repaid: The total principal repaid for all loans.
5. Final Loan Balance: The remaining loan balance at the end of the loan term.


 Calculation Process

1. Data Aggregation:
   - Each loan's cash flows are calculated separately for each period and then combined into a single consolidated dataset.
   - Aggregation is done by summing up the respective columns for payment, prepayment, interest, and principal.

2. Final Loan Balance:
   - At the end of the term for all loans, the remaining balances are summed up. Ideally, this should be $0 if all loans are fully repaid.

3. Outputs:
   - The summarized cash flows are saved in an aggregated format as:
     - CSV: aggregated_amortization_schedule.csv
     - Excel: aggregated_amortization_schedule.xlsx

 Usage

The consolidated cash flow summary is critical for:

1. Loan Portfolio Management: Provides insights into the overall cash inflows and outflows from the portfolio of loans.
2. Forecasting: Helps predict future cash flows, allowing for better financial planning.
3. Performance Monitoring: Tracks the effectiveness of prepayments and the cost of borrowing (interest payments).

 Final Notes

- The consolidated cash flow summary ensures that all financial metrics are transparent and easy to interpret.
- For detailed cash flows by loan or period, refer to the Consolidated Amortization Schedule or the Aggregated Amortization Schedule outputs.

 Consolidated Summary of All Cash Flows

The consolidated summary aggregates all cash flows across loans, providing a clear overview of total payments, prepayments, interest, and principal by date. This is essential for assessing the cumulative impact of multiple loans on cash flow over time.

---

 Key Metrics in the Consolidated Summary
1. Date: The specific date of the cash flow event.
2. Loan Number: Identification of loans contributing to the cash flow.
3. Total Payment: Sum of scheduled monthly payments across all loans for the given date.
4. Total Prepayment: Aggregate prepayments across loans due to the Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR).
5. Total Interest: Total interest paid across loans for the given date.
6. Total Principal: Total principal paid across loans for the given date.
7. Closing Balance: The remaining total loan balance after the payments on the given date.

 Steps to Generate Consolidated Summary
1. Group by Date and Loan Number:
   - Aggregate the amortization schedule by date and loan number using summation for cash flow metrics and taking the last value for the closing balance.

2. Summarize Across Loans:
   - Sum the aggregated cash flows for all loans on each date.

3. Export Consolidated Summary:
   - Save the summarized data to CSV and Excel formats for further analysis or reporting.
