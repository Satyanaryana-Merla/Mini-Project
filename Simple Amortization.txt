 Loan Amortization Documentation

 Overview
This process involves generating loan amortization schedules for multiple loans with varying parameters, including different loan amounts, term lengths, and interest rates. The procedure calculates the monthly payments, generates a detailed amortization schedule, handles prepayments based on a prepayment rate (CPR), and aggregates the results for further analysis.

 Key Components

1. Loan Parameters:
   - Loan Amount: The total amount of the loan.
   - Annual Interest Rate: The fixed annual rate of interest applied to the loan.
   - Term (in Months): The number of months over which the loan will be repaid.
   - CPR (Conditional Prepayment Rate): The rate at which prepayments are expected to occur, either provided as a percentage or a decimal.

2. Amortization Calculations:
   - Monthly Payment: The fixed monthly payment calculated using the loan amortization formula. If the interest rate is 0%, the payment is simply the loan amount divided by the number of months.
   - CPR Conversion: If the CPR is provided as a percentage (e.g., 5%), it is converted into a decimal (e.g., 0.05).
   - SMM (Single Monthly Mortality): A calculation based on CPR, which helps determine the expected prepayment amount each month.
   - Loan Amortization Schedule: A month-by-month breakdown of the loan repayment, including:
     - Interest: The interest payment based on the remaining loan balance.
     - Prepayment: The amount paid off early according to the CPR.
     - Principal: The portion of the monthly payment applied to reduce the loan balance.
     - Closing Balance: The remaining loan balance after accounting for the principal payment and prepayment.

3. Amortization Schedule Generation:
   - The amortization schedule is generated for each loan, showing monthly payments, interest, prepayments, and remaining balances.
   - The schedule runs until the loan balance reaches zero or the term length is completed.

4. Consolidation and Aggregation:
   - Consolidated Schedule: All individual loan schedules are combined into one dataset, ordered by loan number and date.
   - Aggregated Schedule: The consolidated schedule is then aggregated by date and loan number, providing a summarized view of payments, prepayments, interest, principal, and closing balances.

5. Output Formats:
   - CSV Files: The results are saved as CSV files, providing an easily accessible format for further analysis.
   - Excel Files: The consolidated and aggregated schedules are also saved in Excel format for users who prefer working with spreadsheets.

 Detailed Steps

1. Reading Input Data:
   - The input loan data is read from an Excel file, which includes the loan start date, term length (in months), and CPR for each loan.
   
2. Monthly Payment Calculation:
   - For each loan, the monthly payment is computed using the loan amortization formula, which factors in the loan amount, the interest rate, and the term length.

3. CPR Handling:
   - CPR values, which can be expressed as percentages or decimals, are converted into decimals for consistent calculation.

4. Amortization Schedule Creation:
   - For each loan, the amortization schedule is generated month-by-month, considering the monthly payment, interest charges, prepayments, and remaining balances.

5. Saving the Results:
   - The results are saved in two forms:
     - A consolidated amortization schedule that includes all loans in a single dataset, showing each periods details for each loan.
     - An aggregated amortization schedule that groups the data by date and loan number, providing a summary of the total payments, prepayments, interest, principal, and closing balance for each loan across all periods.

6. Final Output:
   - The schedules are saved as:
     - CSV files: `converted_loan_data.csv`, `consolidated_amortization_schedule.csv`, and `aggregated_amortization_schedule.csv`
     - Excel files: `consolidated_amortization_schedule.xlsx` and `aggregated_amortization_schedule.xlsx`

 Key Functions

1. `calculate_monthly_payment`: Computes the monthly payment for a loan based on the loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan term (in months).
   
2. `calculate_smm`: Calculates the Single Monthly Mortality (SMM) from the CPR, which is used to estimate the prepayment amount.

3. `generate_amortization_schedule`: Generates the detailed amortization schedule for a loan, including interest, principal, prepayments, and balance for each period.

 Output Files

1. `converted_loan_data.csv`: A CSV file containing the loan details, including loan amount, interest rate, start date, term length, payment, and CPR.
   
2. `consolidated_amortization_schedule.csv`: A CSV file with the full amortization schedule for all loans, with each periods data for interest, principal, payment, prepayment, and balance.

3. `aggregated_amortization_schedule.csv`: A CSV file with the aggregated summary of all loans, showing total payments, interest, prepayments, principal, and closing balance for each date and loan number.

4. `consolidated_amortization_schedule.xlsx`: An Excel version of the consolidated amortization schedule.

5. `aggregated_amortization_schedule.xlsx`: An Excel version of the aggregated amortization schedule.

 Conclusion

This process provides a comprehensive analysis of loan amortization, incorporating monthly payments, interest calculations, prepayments based on CPR, and consolidated/aggregated views of the results. It is designed for use in financial analysis and loan servicing, enabling stakeholders to track loan performance over time and understand the impacts of prepayments.
